1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I want to share / collaborate with othes.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because the change I made could be wrong or not done. 

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
-Fork: copy a repository of others on GitHub server
-Clone: copy a repository from server to local or locally
-Branch: add a new way to the existing branch.
