What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A folder named .git will be created. This folder is neccessary for hoding commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is media period between working directory and repository. It's no longer a file but not yet a commit (metadata). So the value which it offers could be flexibility that allows us to change our mind in making commits anytime.
